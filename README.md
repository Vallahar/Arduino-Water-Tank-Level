# Arduino: Water Tank Level

Little project to create a Water Tank level device.

**Context:** My dad has a motor disability, and our house water tank is placed at an unreachable location of the house for him.
I'm usually in charge of satisfying his curiosity, however, since I'm studying abroad I cannot always be there for it. Plus it's hard for my mom to reach the water tank as well.

##Things I'd like this to do:
- Measure the water level of a 5.000 liters tank.
- Broadcast the information via Wi-Fi to an app on my parents' phones.
- Power itself through solar energy.

##Other cool features:
- Measure how much water is entering the tank at any moment.
** Track this information with a graph.
- Track its own temperature and power levels and broadcast them.
- **[POWER?]** Serve as a simple weather station?
** Track "how sunny it is" and humidity perhaps.
